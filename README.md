## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

# Muar-in-Motion

# Introduction
Muar-in-Motion is a project initiated by The Muara (FG 21), a flagship project under the IIUM Flagship Project. Developed in collaboration between the Kulliyyah of Languages and Management (KLM) and Tanjung Kunang Enterprise, the project aims to promote and enhance the tourism industry in the Muar region [8]. The Muar-in-Motion web application is a vital tool designed to assist in achieving this mission. It serves as an intuitive platform for potential tourists, providing easy access to important information, including details about tourist attractions, transportation options, accommodation, and a seamless communication platform for visitors to connect and plan their trips.

## Background of the Problem
This project focuses on enhancing and promoting tourism in Muar. The existing flagship website lacks tourist-specific information, hindering effective travel planning. While other places have adopted smart tourism, Muar is yet to implement such a system. Therefore, there is a need for a new website that is tourist-centered, helping visitors plan their trips to Muar effectively.

## Problem Statement
Tourists exploring Muar often face challenges in navigating and locating specific information, hindering their trip planning. To address this, a centralized and user-friendly platform is essential, providing comprehensive information on Muar's attractions, accommodations, transportation options, and events. Improved accessibility to this information enhances tourists' experiences, aligning with the Muara Flagship project's vision of boosting the tourism industry in Muar.

## Objective
The system's development aims to promote and enhance tourism in Muar by meeting the needs of tourists, driving economic growth, and showcasing the region's attractions. The system should simplify travel planning, encourage visitor engagement, and feature a user-friendly interface for smooth navigation.

## Project Scope
1. **Views:**
   - Admin can log in to manage posts in tourist attractions, transportation, accommodation, events, and monitor the forum for malicious content.
   - Visitors can view home, attractions, transportation, accommodation, forum, event, and about us pages. They can bookmark content, create a to-do-list, and participate in discussions if logged in.
  
2. **Target User:**
   - Potential tourists of Muar, Johor.

3. **Platform Used:**
   - PHP, Laravel, MYSQL, Figma, Draw.io, and Procreate
